Related Pages is a plugin for dotclear. It aims to provide a simple way to serve pages, templates and scripts.

The main developement has been made by Pep - https://nrkn.fr/ and maintained over the years by nikrou - https://www.nikrou.net/

I will now try to maintain that plugin so that it can be used in recent dotclear releases.

# Installation

You can install the plugin from your dotclear administration area.
