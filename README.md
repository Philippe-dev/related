Related Pages is a plugin for dotclear.
This plugin aims to provide a simple way to add pages.
It also aims to provide a simple way to serve theses pages and scripts.

The main developement has been made by Pep - https://nrkn.fr/ and maintained over the tears by nikrou - https://www.nikrou.net/

I will now try to maintain that plugin so that it can be used in recent dotclear releases.
